# Feature Engineering and Selection 
- Feature Engineering for Time Series Forecasting 
  - Imputation (Forward fill and backfill)
  - Outliers ( Identify, Dummy variable)
  - Transformation ((Log, Box Cox)
  - Encoding (One hot, Target mean, integer)
  - Temporal (Cyclical feature encoding, calendar day, week, month)
  - Past Features ( Lag features, Window features)
  - Trend and Seasonality (time variable, changepoint, step changes)
